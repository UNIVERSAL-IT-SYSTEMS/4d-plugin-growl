##About

This plugin is based on the [Growl-2.0.1-SDK](http://growl.info).

If you don't have Growl running, or if you have configured Growl to used the Notification Center, a system notification will be posted instead.

Unlike the ``DISPLAY NOTIFICATION`` command of 4D, the notification will always be displayed, even if the application was the frontmost. However, you have less control of the icon if you don't use Growl; the icon is decided from the application name.
